# Project Setup

Follow these instructions to get started with the project.

## Installation

1. Install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the application using your preferred method.

## File Structure

The file structure is consistent across all user types. Please adhere to the conventions as closely as possible.

## Linting

- **ESLint is set up.**  
  Run the following command to lint your code:
  ```bash
  npx eslint .
  ```
  
- **Pre-commit Git Hook:**  
  A pre-commit hook is in place and functioning. Before committing, ESLint will parse through the code and suggest changes. It's recommended to review all suggestions manually instead of using the `--fix` option automatically.

## Routing

`App.js` currently handles routing for all user sections' login pages. The routing can be modified by the team as needed.
